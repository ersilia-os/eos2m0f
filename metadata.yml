Title: Staphylococcus aureus activity prediction
Description: Staphylococcus aureus activity prediction based on phenotypic 
  ChEMBL data. Each column corresponds to a specific bioactivity dataset derived
  from ChEMBL, encompassing multiple assays and binarization cut-offs. The 
  global consensus score summarizes the probability of being active. Model 
  developed by Ersilia.
Deployment:

Input:
  - Compound
Input Dimension: 1
Output: Score
Output Dimension: 51
Output Consistency: Fixed
Interpretation: The higher the probabilities and the global consensus scores, 
  the more likely this compound is active against Staphylococcus aureus
